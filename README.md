# cFarms - Spigot Farms Plugin

## Overview
cFarms is a Spigot plugin that adds functionalities related to agriculture and crop cultivation. The main goal of the plugin is to optimize the speed at which crops grow without needing to alter the ticks of the entire server.

## Key Features

### 1. Plant Cultivation
cFarms allows players to cultivate a variety of plants, including wheat, carrots, potatoes, melons, pumpkins, and nether warts. The plugin adds support for different growth stages for each type of plant, offering a realistic progression from planting to harvesting.

### 2. Repeatable Plants
Certain plants, such as melons, pumpkins, and cacti, are repeatable, meaning they can continue growing even after reaching the maximum stage of growth. cFarms manages this behavior, allowing players to cultivate these plants indefinitely as long as they maintain the appropriate conditions.

### 3. Environmental Interaction
The plugin also takes into account the environment surrounding the crops. For example, when planting a cactus, the plugin checks if there is sand below to ensure the plant can grow properly. This interaction with the environment enhances the realism and immersion in gameplay.

### 4. Automated Growth
cFarms includes an automated growth system where crops grow over time without the need for direct intervention from players. This feature allows players to focus on other activities while their crops mature naturally.

### 5. Task Scheduling
To ensure consistent crop growth, the plugin utilizes a task scheduling system. This means that growth stages are scheduled to occur at specific times, providing a more controlled and predictable gaming experience.

### 6. Visual Feedback
cFarms provides visual feedback to players to indicate the progress of their crops. This includes growth animations and visual effects to highlight when plants reach new stages of development. This feedback helps players track the growth of their crops.
